## 0.1.1

- `@argument` tags can now be formatted in a table by setting the `tabular_arguments` option to true
- `@argument_scope`: a new tag that improves the formatting of endpoint arguments that are scoped by a common prefix (e.g, nested inside a json object), like `user[name]` => `name`
- `@argument` can now parse accepted values in two formats; inline within the types array, or by explicitly writing it in the tag text using any of `Accepted values: [...]`, `Accepts: [...]`, or `Possible values: [...]`
- A new option: `strict_arguments` that provides a default for the `is_required` property of `@argument` tags. This default is used if the tag does not explicitly state `Optional` or `Required` in its type specifier.
- Support for dynamic javascript and style code based on options. See `templates/layout/setup.rb#inline_{javascripts,stylesheets}`
- A new set of options for customizing layout: `content_width`, `sidebar_width` and `spacer`
